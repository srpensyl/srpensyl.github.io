    <h2>Reading through E. M. Forster Texts through Text Encoding and Voyant</h2>
    <p>5 texts by E. M. Forster were viewed and analyzed to determine his writing style, common themes in his works, and how these aspects in each text compare to one another. Not only will analyzation reveal the writing patterns Forster follows, but it will also provide an introspective look into how Forster viewed the world around him, while piecing together a collection of his thoughts. </p>
    <p>The longest Forster text analyzed was Howards End with A Passage to India, The Longest Journey, A Room with a View, and Where Angels Fear to Tread following respectively. The average words per sentence remained within less 3 points of each other, and the readability indexes remained within 1.5 points of each other. The document lengths of and vocabulary density of the texts were found to have an inverse relationship. As the length of the text decreased, the vocabulary density increased. For example, Where Angels Fear to Tread has the shortest length of the texts studied, but the greatest vocabulary density. The distinctive words for each text are comprised of character names that are unique to each story, showing that Forster uses similar language when writing different texts. This data assists in laying a foundation for understanding and recognizing Forster’s writing patterns. </p>
<p>E. M. Forster’s writing style and writing patterns can be easily defined by his heavy use of dialogue and his use of interwoven religious and societal themes. Dialogue is prominent in Forster’s works as it is used to primarily move the plot along through the texts. A representation of this facet is seen when accounting all five works and noting that the most frequently written word is “said.”</p>

  <p>The use of the word “said” is recorded 2,227 times in the corpus, with the word included over a thousand more times than that of the second most frequent word. The highest frequency of “said” in any of the 5 texts is seen in the second shortest text, A Room with a View. Meanwhile, the longest text, A Passage to India, includes the smallest frequency of “said.” </p>
<iframe style='width: 637px; height: 503px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=9d95aaa6268e5840bd4daedb5d95366b&query=said&view=Trends'></iframe>
<p>This showcases how Forster’s writing is able to rely on dialogue to depict and complete his stories. In Where Angels Fear to Tread, based on an expanded look at a chapter applied to the rest of the text, dialogue comprises an estimated 75% to 85% of the text. The primary use of dialogue immerses the reader further into the story, as if they are there witnessing the back-and-forth comments. The conversations created an added sense of comedy as the characters use dramatized language.</p>
<code><p><dialogue>“When she got there, there was some pretty domestic scene between him
and the baby, and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism.
Before very long, if I know anything about psychology, there will be a
reaction. She’ll be swept back.”</p></dialogue></code>
<p>Religious themes are seen to be common amongst Forster’s texts. Characters travel to churches and discuss fate, as religious metaphors are woven throughout Forster’s narrative and character conversation. Terms relating to “god,” “religio,” (to account for variations of the word “religion”) and church can be seen in the text collective a total of 289 times, 63 times, and 137 times respectively.</p>

<p> It can be assumed there are more specific religious references in the texts, but it would be difficult to record these instances without scanning the texts word for word. A Passage to India holds the most religious references which is ironic as one text features the word “angels” in the title. When delving further into Where Angels Fear to Tread, the religious themes can be further examined to highlight how they are intertwined with the story and with another theme of failure. The use of these themes created a paradox in the work between having faith and expecting failure.</p>
<code><theme type="failure">"In her death, as in her life, <person name="Santa_Deodata">Santa Deodata</person> did not accomplish
much.""</theme></code>
<p>Forster’s works become dated as antiquated social norms and language recognized in his writing. Characters are often referred to by courtesy titles and their surnames, for example in Where Angels Fear to Tread when a character Caroline Abbott is consistently referred to as “Miss Abbott.”</p>
<code><dialogue>"Why, <person name="Caroline_Abbott">Miss Abbott</person>, you can’t expect me to follow
you through all these turns--”</dialogue></p></code>
<p>The terms “Mrs.,” “Mr.,” and “Miss” can be seen included in the top 5 of terms most commonly found in the texts. This is representative of the Edwardian period of the early 1900s, when Forster completed the texts, as during this period it was proper to refer to people by these titles. This also highlights Forster’s references to societal and class norms.</p>

<p>Another reminder of the time period is the use of outdated slang and phrases throughout the text. There are a few unfamiliar words that needed to be defined in modern context to be understood. It is not surprising as the English language has evolved from that of Forster’s lifetime.</p>
<code><p><dialogue>“Good <define>ickle</define> quiet boysey, then.”</dialogue></p></code>
<p>An area that is puzzling in Forster’s work is the use of fictional places and landmarks. While it is common for authors to fabricate settings, it is less common for authors to set the scene with both existent and fictitious places. In Where Angels Fear to Tread, the story plays through parts of Italy and the UK, where mentions of Florence and Sienna are seen. With these cities, Forster created towns and cafes like “Monteriano” and “Caffee Garibaldi” are also discussed. The use of both can be a call to the fact that the story is meant to represent aspects of society, while still reminding the viewer that the story is exaggerated and falsified.</p>
<code>He knew the landmarks pretty well: here was the crossroad to <place type="town" name="Poggibonsi">Poggibonsi</place>; and the last view of
<place type="fictional town" name="Monteriano">Monteriano</place>, if they had light, would be from here.</code>
<p>Comparing the texts in this corpus showcases Foster’s unique style of dialogue writing, reflecting his common motif of representing the humor and societal differences found in human interaction. Forster skirts the edges of reality while being able to place the viewer in a dramatized fiction, pondering how religion and social class influence reality and life. Forster appears to write from his own experience during a period of social change.</p>
