    <p>During the 2025 spring semester in my Digital Humanities 100 class, I was introduced to the Dear Data project. This project was created and completed by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. Each week, for a year, Lupi and Posavec collected and recorded data about their lives, sending it to each other on postcards. In my Digital Humanities class, I was tasked to complete a project following the same guidelines as Dear Data. I chose to record each time I was called by my name, “Sierra” and “Miss Sierra.” Below is a picture of the data I collected from January 31, 2025, to February 7, 2025.</p>
