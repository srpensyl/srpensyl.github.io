      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>While recreating the Elizabot. I decided to take inspiration from my favorite TV show Supernatural. I restructured the code of Eliza to turn the bot into a sort of bestiary for supernatural beings that are mentioned throughout the show. I used my own knowledge and the help of the <a href="https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Supernatural:_The_Men_of_Letters_Bestiary:_Winchester_Family_Edition">Supernatural Fandom</a> website to gather information used in the script. The user acts as a supernatural hunter asking questions about the lore of different supernatural beings to best track and hunt them. I changed the initials and finals of the bot to reflect key phrases in the show, having the primary final being one of Supernatural’s common catchphrases. I named the bot Winchester after the last names of the two main characters of the show. I tried to mimic the language that the characters would use on the show for Winchester’s responses, so it was as if the user is talking to another Supernatural character.  The bot contains information on monsters from demons to vampires, including each category’s strengths and weaknesses. Characters are mentioned throughout the script to make the bot more immersive in the Supernatural world. When prompted, Winchester will provide a brief explanation for every character mentioned in the script, so those unfamiliar will be able to follow along. Weapons that are unique to the show will also be explained by Winchester when prompted. Overall, I am hoping that Winchester provides a fun interactive way for fans of Supernatural to take part in the narrative and imagine what it would be like to be a hunter in the show.</p>
