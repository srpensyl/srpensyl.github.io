    <h1>Game Making</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I took inspiration for the concept of the game from Jackson Katz’s The Macho Paradox. In the book, Katz includes a survey of “Things men and women do on a daily basis to stay safe.” The survey answers from women consisted of a long list of precautions they take throughout their day to stay safe, while the men’s answers consisted of one: “Nothing. I don’t think about it.” I found it interesting how profoundly different men and women experience and go about everyday activities and actions. I decided to design a game that would take the user through 24 hours of daily activities where they would have to choose the right precautions to take to survive until the next morning. The game includes various passages consisting of scenarios with 2 to 3 multiple choice answers. There are a total of 26 different endings throughout the game, with only one ending occurring when the user makes it through all 24 hours. The other 25 endings consist of different scenarios where the user failed to take the necessary precautions and is attacked, resulting in having to restart the game to continue playing.

The first passage of the game allows users to input their name for future reference in congratulatory passages later in the game. While the user completes the game, they are able to track the hours left in their 24 hours and the number of attacks they have been able to avoid or escape. The user’s inventory of pepper spray, based on user choices in the start of the game, is displayed for a short time in the beginning passages as needed. Displayed throughout the game is the number of women attacked in the United States every hour. The number corresponds with the user’s hour countdown, the numbers acting inversely as they change. The statistic of women attacked used in the game is based on the estimation that every 9 seconds in the US a woman is assaulted or beaten. These statistics were taken from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

I included eerie music to loop during the user’s play to bring a serious and suspenseful atmosphere, building off the idea of fear felt by women as they complete the tasks referenced in the game. Figuring out how to include the audio was the most difficult aspect of creating the game. After initially adding the code for the audio, it would not play while I was testing the game. I took hours to try and figure out what wasn’t clicking together. The audio still only plays sometimes for me when I go to play the game out of test mode. I also wanted to include an image, but every time I would code one into a passage it would not show on the game. In the completed game, I left out any imaging, but I eventually want to go back and fix the issues I was facing to add in an image.

The initial audience I had in mind for this game was men because of the drastic difference in the way they view daily safety, based on the survey from where I took inspiration. As I was creating the game, my target audience also expanded to women. It would be interesting to see how similar different women’s safety precautions are and what some women have never considered. These thoughts were brought on from allowing my mom to test the game. She played a few times and never made it to the halfway point. Overall, I want the game to assist in spreading awareness and understanding of violence against women.
